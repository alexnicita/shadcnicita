Everyone knows what a market is. No one knows what a market is not. Try to define the opposite of the noun “market,” ideally with one word. This is a complex task; counterintuitively, it is also a worthwhile task. Consider the exercise a quasi proof by contradiction. By working towards a definition of what a market is not, we can come to understand the true foundation of markets, and most importantly, arrive at the definition of a good market. 

Trading goods and services, swapping financial instruments, shaking hands, trucking, bartering, and exchanging are all common market behaviors. Obviously, some behaviors are less transactional than others. But in our modern economic society, can any action be fully distinguished from market behavior?

Instinctively, yes, the opposite of a market must exist. Families are not typically markets. Friendships are rarely market-based relationships. Volunteer communities are another such example. Yet upon further reflection, all of these non-market social units require some exchanges of value in order to function well. What are most mortgages other than happy families borrowing money to buy property? Everywhere anyone steps has become the product of an abstract market.

Could charity be the opposite of a market? Perhaps a non-profit? Consider the etymology of charity. The latin word caritas has an ethos that communicates benevolence, seemingly in stark contrast to the intense, almost brutal ruthlessness of traders shouting numbers on the floor of a stock exchange. However, those who can charge the most for an hour of their time, those who have set unprecedented records of financial success, those who have essentially won the market – they are the philanthropists. Caritas is nothing other than the epitome of the market.

The best answer appears to be choice. If you are making a real choice, then you are not deciding based on external pressure. Choice is the opposite of coercion. A real choice in the purest sense of the phrase is one that is made from your own unique perceptions, beliefs, and values. These types of choices are authentic expressions of free will, distinct from the influences of market powers, absent from the weighing of options, and surely devoid of optimizations that are governed by incentives. Such an action could never be rooted in any economic tradeoffs, therefore choice is the antonym of market.

Good markets increase the frequency of these real, pure, and authentic choices. They open doors, promote freedom, and empower us to follow intuition into abundance. Markets have limitations, which are paradoxically important for our safety, but the essence of perfect market design is still unlimited choices. If one seeks to pursue creating better markets, one must invent technologies that create opportunities for individuals to choose what they know to be best for themselves. Choose wisely.
