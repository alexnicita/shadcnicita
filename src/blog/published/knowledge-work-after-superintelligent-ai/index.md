Every major technological wave creates new labor categories. Mobile created Swift and Kotlin engineers, social media managers, and much more. Cloud created DevOps. Cars, truck drivers. Steam engines, railroad workers. The pattern has repeated for centuries, although not yet for AI.

What we refer to as "Applied AI" is no more creative than "Applied Mobile" or "Applied Cloud," both nonexistent historically. Prompt engineers, conversational designers, or even data labelers are admittedly actually new concepts, but they are far too narrow in their scope to articulate true economic durability on par with doctor, lawyer, or accountant. There must be a middle ground.

<strong><em>What is fundamental to AI that will shape the new, durable categories of work that it creates?</em></strong>

AI is artificial. Human receptionists can answer only one call at a time and must sleep. Voice AI receptionists, equipped with tools for scheduling and payments, have no such limitations. This repeats across all rote cognitive roles. AI removes natural human bottlenecks from reasoning.

AI is not philosophically physical. While there are physical requirements to build frontier models, increasing demand for datacenter construction, energy production, and adjacent infrastructure, and while there are interfaces for AI to control physical systems, reasoning cannot be material.

AI is not yet superintelligent. Automating neurosurgery is still meaningfully more complex than a medical receptionist. The same is true in most specialized fields requiring continued education.

<strong><em>What are the early signs of the labor market structurally adapting to fit superintelligence?</em></strong>

Some labor categories have begun to emerge in service of creating superintelligence, notably the new marketplaces matching specialized workers with foundation model companies to tutor, evaluate, and transfer our most siloed knowledge, benchmarking AI's proximity to human parity.

Other new types of emerging, post-ASI work operationalize superintelligence. These are direct reflections of prior corporate jobs, such as search engine optimization giving way to generative answer engine optimization. Familiar roles reappear in altered forms, hedging against a future takeoff to superintelligence happening faster than anticipated. We are certainly on the tarmac.

**Takeoff.**

Inevitable commoditized intelligence, soon able to instantly reason for unlimited human years, introduces legitimate questioning on the returns of most, if not all, traditional human cognition.

The lasting categories of knowledge work in our post-ASI society will be defined by the select companies that ultimately figure out how to masterfully place people into AI's loops, efficiently orchestrating intelligence and allocating reasoning.

The real future is not actually here yet.

How should it be distributed?
